# Android Homeaway Challenge

Coding implementation for the HomeAway Android challenge.

## Features

- Foursquare API integration for Venue Search in Seattle, WA
- Google Maps API integration to dipsplay venues in relation to the heart of Seattle
- Venue Detail information provided, if available

## Installation

To download this project, use `git`. Run the following commands in the directory of your choice:

```
git clone git@github.com:newkirkjosh/android-homeaway-challenge.git <optional-local-dir-name>
```

To run the project, open up Android Studio and click `Open an existing Android Studio project`.
From there select the main directory for the project and let gradle handle the rest! If you run into issues, I recommed selecting `Build -> Clean Project` from the menu and then trying to rebuild the project.

## Notes

This project will be deleted along with any API keys used after the challenge is over.
